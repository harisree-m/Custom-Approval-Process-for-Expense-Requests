#Expense Request Approval Automator

#Problem Statement

The Expense Request Approval Automator is a Salesforce-based solution designed to streamline and automate the entire employee expense approval workflow. It eliminates manual tracking and inefficiencies by introducing a structured, rule-driven process. Employees can easily submit expenses, managers can review them with configurable thresholds, and finance teams can ensure compliance — all within Salesforce.

#Key Features

Automated Submission & Routing: Expense requests are automatically routed to the right approvers (manager, finance team) based on configurable approval thresholds.

Approval Workflow Automation: Records are locked on submission, and system-driven actions update status (Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected).

Automated Notifications: Employees and managers receive real-time email alerts on submission, approval, and rejection, ensuring transparency.

Data-Driven Tracking: All expense requests and related items are stored in Salesforce, enabling finance teams to monitor spending patterns and enforce compliance rules.

Scalable Design: The process can be expanded to support multi-level approvals, conditional routing, and integration with HR or accounting systems.

#Technologies Used

Salesforce Platform: Core business platform hosting objects, data, and security.

Approval Processes: Salesforce’s built-in approval workflow engine to automate routing, record locking, and actions.

Salesforce Flow / Workflow Rules: Low-code automation to handle notifications, status updates, and field validations.

Apex (Optional): For advanced business logic like dynamic approver assignment or integration with external systems.

Reports & Dashboards: Provide managers and finance with insights into expense trends, approval bottlenecks, and compliance metrics.
